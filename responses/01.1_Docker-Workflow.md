# Edit the workflow file

## Step 2: Edit the workflow file

We are going to edit the current workflow file in our repository by adding adding a job that turns our `Dockerfile` into a `Docker Image`.

### :keyboard: Activity: Edit the workflow file and turn the Dockerfile into a Docker Image

1. [Edit the current workflow file in our repository]({{ repoUrl }}/blob/docker-workflow/.github/workflows/ci-workflow.yml)
2. Rename `ci-workflow.yml` to `docker-workflow.yml`:
        ![screenshot of renaming file from ci-workflow.yml to docker-workflow.yml](https://i.imgur.com/txXJgr5.png)
3. On line 1, change the name from `Node CI` to `Docker CD`
        ```yaml
        name: Docker CD
        ```
4. Add the following job to your workflow file:
      ```yaml

      Build-and-Push-Docker-Image:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      needs: test
      name: Docker Build, Tag, Push
      steps:
            - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v1

            - name: Download built artifact
      uses: actions/download-artifact@master
      with:
      name: webpack artifacts
      path: public

            - name: Build, Tag, Push
      uses: mattdavis0351/actions/docker-gpr@v1
      with:
      repo-token: {% raw %}${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}{% endraw %}
      image-name: tic-tac-toe
      ```
5. Commit the newly edited workflow file to your repository
